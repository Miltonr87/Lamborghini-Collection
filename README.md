### About

Made with React and Mobile First techniques, the Web APP consumes an FireBase API created by me with 10 magazine covers. The idea was to recreate an atmosphere produced by the dating Tinder APP with information from the famous Playboy Magazines of all time. The user can interact and decide what magazines liked or not. A special Chat Area and Authentication Login were also added to the project. The next step is to authenticate via accounts on Google / Facebook used React Redux knowledge. 

!ATTENTION!: none of the magazines that appears in the application feature naked women. They are just reproductions of classic magazines! In other words, Playboy here (and all images rights), are being used only as a means of communication in a React learning process. The author is not responsible for any improper use of the brand or Web APP.

### Getting Started
